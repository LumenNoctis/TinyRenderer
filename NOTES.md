This project deserves notes.

Somehow, the x and y axis became swapped, but it seems to be the only way I can get this to render properly.

I have made several  iterations of the transform.c trrying to fix this.
My theory is that my matrix multiplication is inverted, but as I said, I went through multiple iterations trying to fix it to no avail.

I should still fix it before I add matrix multiplication to MT.h
